# MiniC-Compiler
This is a school project to make a simple C compiler which aim to process minimal C syntax.

The compiler has been entirely written in python3 and should work out of the box on any OS with that of python.
This version is consider a pre-alpha build and it should be use only with educational purposes; After you have cloned the project, to compile it just run, in the terminal or command prompt, cmake MiniC-Compiler to create the Makefile and then run the command make to generate the executable.
If you wish, you should feel free to collaborate with the project, I would read and try apply any suggestion I receive :).
