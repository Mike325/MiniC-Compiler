# MiniC-Compiler
This is a school project to make a simple C compiler which aim to process
minimal C syntax.

The compiler has been entirely written in python 3.5 and should work out
of the box on any OS with that of python, although it has only been tested in
Linux

This version is consider a pre-alpha build and it should be use only
with educational purposes; After you have cloned the project, to compile it
just run the main.py file in the terminal or command prompt, the output shoud be
an assembly file `<name_of_the_file>.asm` with a valid x86 instructions.

```sh
$ python3 ./main.py ejemplo.c
```

I would read and try apply any suggestion I receive :).
