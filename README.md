# MiniC-Compiler
This is a school project to make a simple C compiler which aim to process minimal C syntax.

The compiler is entirely written in C++, using standard STL templates, so it can be compiled in almost any platform.
It also use the CMake script to generate the standard Makefile.

This version is consider a pre-alpha build and it should be use only with educational purposes; After you have cloned the project, to compile it just run, in the terminal or command prompt, cmake MiniC-Compiler to create the Makefile and then run the command make to generate the executable.

If you wish, you should feel free to collaborate with the project, I would read and try apply any suggestion I receive :).
